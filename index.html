                    <p>
                        â€‹Harira is a classic Moroccan comfort soup made with tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, fresh
                        herbs, dried spices, and meat, making it a filling and satisfying dish. Although served
                        year-round, it is particularly popular for breaking the fast during Ramadan.
